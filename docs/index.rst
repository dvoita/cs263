To install Ruby, you can use your system's package management 
tool. I am using Fedora 18 Linux, so the command looks like this::

   $ sudo yum install ruby ruby-devel gcc libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel

To make working with Ruby easier, I recommend using RVM, the Ruby 
enVironment Manager.  RVM is a great tool for managing multiple Ruby 
environments.  With RVM it is easy to setup different projects to 
use different versions of Ruby and different gem sets.  I will not 
go into great detail here, as using RVM is not necessary to try my 
examples. But I will cover how to get up and running with or without RVM.
